# Calendar API automation

This is a projet I've been working on since some time now (I know it's not much). It's an automation script written in Python 3.9.0 and currently only the show function is working.

You need to have a `credentials.json` file in the current folder (get it from the Calendar API website) and (I know it's kinda obvious) a google account.
